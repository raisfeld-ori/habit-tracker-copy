based on a video by conatius ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jXIybnDYRU ). i thought this would be simple to make so i made a demo out of it.

# why?
i thought this would be simple to create (unlike his usual videos, which are very impressive), so i wanted to try it out.

# how to use:
this is just a normal python project, since i didn't even need rust to make this lol.
but for anyone who doesn't know how to use python:
make sure to install python from python.org. second, you need to install every module
needed for the project, which is just PyQt5 (since PyQt6 had an error in the designer,
and i was lazy to fix it). if you're using linux then create an env
using ```python -M venv env``` and then use ```env/bin/activate``` to activate it.
after that, use ```pip install PyQt5`` to install PyQt5, and run ```python main.py``` to run it.
this should give a bunch of errors, but continue working regardless.
